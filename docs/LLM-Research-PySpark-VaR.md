# PySpark for Finance Risk Management - Beginner Session

Thank you for sharing your background! With your Python experience and familiarity with Pandas and NumPy, you have a solid foundation to build PySpark skills for finance risk management.

## PySpark Fundamentals for Finance

PySpark is the Python API for Apache Spark, enabling distributed data processing across multiple computers simultaneously - perfect for the large datasets common in financial risk analysis. 【1】【2】

### Why PySpark is Valuable in Finance Risk Management

Financial institutions use PySpark for:

1. Calculating investment risk levels 
2. Processing large-scale banking transactions for fraud detection 
3. Credit risk analysis and evaluation 
4. Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations at scale 
5. Portfolio risk management and diversification analysis 

## Getting Started with PySpark for Finance

Let's begin with setting up PySpark and understanding its basic structure:

```python
# Installing PySpark (run in your terminal)
pip install pyspark[connect]==3.5.5
```

### Basic PySpark Session Setup

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create a Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Finance Risk Management") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

### Loading Financial Data

```python
# Example: Loading financial data
# This could be transaction data, market prices, etc.
financial_data = spark.read.csv("financial_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Display the first few rows
financial_data.show(5)

# Get schema information
financial_data.printSchema()
```

## PySpark vs. Pandas: Key Differences

Since you're familiar with Pandas, here are the key differences:

1. **Scale**: PySpark handles terabytes of data across clusters; Pandas is limited to memory on a single machine
2. **Execution**: PySpark uses lazy evaluation (executes only when needed); Pandas executes immediately
3. **API**: PySpark's DataFrame API is similar to Pandas but with some syntax differences
4. **Performance**: PySpark excels with large datasets; Pandas is faster for smaller datasets

## Simple Risk Analysis Example

Let's implement a basic financial risk calculation using PySpark:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, stddev, mean

# Calculate portfolio volatility (a basic risk measure)
# Assuming we have daily returns in a column called 'returns'
risk_metrics = financial_data.select(
    stddev("returns").alias("volatility"),
    mean("returns").alias("average_return")
)

risk_metrics.show()
```

## Value-at-Risk (VaR) Calculation

VaR is a common risk metric in finance. Here's a simple implementation:

```python
from pyspark.sql.functions import expr, percentile_approx

# Calculate 95% VaR
confidence_level = 0.95
var_calculation = financial_data.select(
    percentile_approx("returns", 1-confidence_level, 10000).alias("VaR_95")
)

var_calculation.show()
```

## Next Steps in Our Learning Path

Based on your background and goals, here's what we'll cover in our upcoming sessions:

1. **Data preprocessing** for financial datasets using PySpark
2. **Feature engineering** for risk models
3. **Machine learning pipelines** for credit risk assessment 
4. **Monte Carlo simulations** for market risk 
5. **Real-time risk monitoring** with streaming data 

## Practice Exercise

Let's start with a simple exercise to get you comfortable with PySpark syntax:

1. Create a PySpark DataFrame with sample financial data
2. Calculate basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for key columns
3. Filter the data based on risk thresholds
4. Group data by categories and analyze risk metrics by group

Would you like to try this exercise now, or would you prefer to focus on a specific aspect of PySpark for finance risk management first?

# Value-at-Risk (VaR) in Financial Risk Management with PySpark

## What is Value-at-Risk (VaR)?

Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure that quantifies the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined time period for a given confidence interval. In simpler terms, VaR answers the question: "How much could I lose with X% confidence over the next N days?" 

For example, a one-day 95% VaR of $1 million means there's a 95% probability that the portfolio won't lose more than $1 million in a single day.

## How VaR Works

VaR calculation typically follows one of three methodologies:

1. **Historical Simulation Method**: Uses historical returns to estimate potential future losses
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import percentile_approx
   
   # Assuming 'returns' column contains daily portfolio returns
   historical_var = financial_data.select(
       percentile_approx("returns", 0.05, 10000).alias("VaR_95_percent")
   )
   ```

2. **Parametric Method (Variance-Covariance)**: Assumes returns follow a normal distribution
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import mean, stddev, lit
   
   # Calculate mean and standard deviation of returns
   stats = financial_data.select(
       mean("returns").alias("mean_return"),
       stddev("returns").alias("std_return")
   ).collect()[0]
   
   # Calculate VaR assuming normal distribution (95% confidence = 1.645 std deviations)
   confidence_factor = 1.645
   parametric_var = stats.mean_return - (confidence_factor * stats.std_return)
   ```

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generates thousands of random scenarios based on statistical properties of the data 
   ```python
   # This would be implemented as a more complex PySpark job
   # involving random number generation and parallel simulations
   ```

## Why VaR is Relevant in Finance Risk Management

VaR has become a standard risk metric in finance because it:

1. Provides a single, easy-to-understand number that quantifies risk
2. Allows comparison of risk across different asset classes and portfolios
3. Helps financial institutions meet regulatory requirements (Basel regulations)
4. Enables risk-based capital allocation and limit setting 

## Implementing VaR at Scale with PySpark

Financial institutions use PySpark for VaR calculations because:

1. It can process massive datasets across distributed systems
2. Monte Carlo simulations can be parallelized efficiently
3. Historical data analysis can be performed on years of market data
4. Real-time risk monitoring becomes feasible 

## Pitfalls and Limitations of VaR

Despite its popularity, VaR has several significant limitations:

1. **Tail Risk Blindness**: VaR says nothing about the severity of losses beyond the confidence threshold
2. **Model Risk**: Different VaR calculation methods can produce vastly different results
3. **Correlation Breakdown**: Correlations between assets often change during market stress
4. **False Sense of Security**: A single number can oversimplify complex risk profiles
5. **Backward-Looking**: Historical data may not predict future market behavior, especially during crises

## Modern Approaches to Enhance VaR

To address these limitations, modern risk management often supplements VaR with:

1. **Conditional VaR (CVaR)**: Measures the expected loss beyond the VaR threshold
   ```python
   from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when, mean
   
   # Calculate CVaR (Expected Shortfall)
   cvar_calculation = financial_data.withColumn(
       "beyond_var", when(col("returns") < var_value, col("returns")).otherwise(None)
   ).select(mean("beyond_var").alias("CVaR_95_percent"))
   ```

2. **Stress Testing**: Simulating extreme but plausible scenarios
3. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Understanding how VaR changes with different assumptions
4. **Alternative Data Integration**: Incorporating non-traditional data sources for more robust risk assessment 

## PySpark Implementation Considerations

When implementing VaR calculations in PySpark for finance risk management:

1. Ensure data quality and completeness
2. Consider computational efficiency for large portfolios
3. Implement proper validation and backtesting procedures
4. Design for both batch processing and near-real-time updates
5. Incorporate model governance and documentation

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of VaR calculation or show you a more detailed PySpark implementation example?

Show me how, assuming standard, tutorial values. Explain the context and input variables of the excel sheet and if and where the implementations (excel vs pyspark) differ, both in technical value as in business value (i.e. how it can be used in financial risk management)>

# Migrating Financial Risk VaR Calculation from Excel to PySpark

## Context: Excel-Based VaR Calculation

In financial risk management, Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations are often initially developed in Excel due to its accessibility and familiarity. Let's assume we have an Excel model that calculates VaR for a portfolio of stocks using the historical simulation method.

### Excel Implementation Context

The Excel sheet typically contains:

1. Historical daily returns for multiple stocks (e.g., 5 stocks over 2 years)
2. Portfolio weights for each stock
3. Calculation of portfolio returns based on weighted stock returns
4. VaR calculation at 95% confidence level using percentile function

## Migrating to PySpark: Implementation

Let's convert this Excel-based VaR calculation to PySpark with proper testing:

### Step 1: Set Up PySpark Environment

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr, percentile_approx, sum, lit, array
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, DoubleType, DateType
import datetime as dt

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Financial Risk VaR Calculation") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

### Step 2: Create Sample Data (Mimicking Excel Input)

```python
# Define schema for stock returns
schema = StructType([
    StructField("date", DateType(), False),
    StructField("AAPL", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("MSFT", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("AMZN", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("GOOGL", DoubleType(), True),
    StructField("META", DoubleType(), True)
])

# Sample data (daily returns as decimals)
# In real implementation, you would load this from a data source
data = [
    (dt.date(2023, 1, 3), 0.02, 0.01, -0.015, 0.005, 0.01),
    (dt.date(2023, 1, 4), -0.01, 0.02, 0.01, -0.005, 0.02),
    (dt.date(2023, 1, 5), 0.005, -0.01, 0.02, 0.01, -0.015),
    # Add more historical data points here
]

# Create DataFrame
returns_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)

# Portfolio weights (as would be defined in Excel)
weights = {"AAPL": 0.25, "MSFT": 0.25, "AMZN": 0.20, "GOOGL": 0.15, "META": 0.15}
```

### Step 3: Implement VaR Calculation Function

```python
def calculate_var(returns_df, weights, confidence_level=0.95):
    """
    Calculate Value-at-Risk using historical simulation method
    
    Args:
        returns_df: DataFrame with date and daily returns by stock
        weights: Dictionary of portfolio weights by stock
        confidence_level: Confidence level for VaR (default 95%)
    
    Returns:
        VaR value at specified confidence level
    """
    # Create a weights DataFrame for joining
    weights_data = [(k, v) for k, v in weights.items()]
    weights_df = spark.createDataFrame(weights_data, ["stock", "weight"])
    
    # Reshape returns from wide to long format
    stocks = [c for c in returns_df.columns if c != "date"]
    returns_long = returns_df.select(
        "date",
        *[expr(f"'{stock}' as stock, {stock} as return") 
          for stock in stocks]
    ).selectExpr("date", "stack(" + str(len(stocks)) + ", " + 
                 ", ".join([f"'{s}', {s}" for s in stocks]) + ") as (stock, return)")
    
    # Join returns with weights
    weighted_returns = returns_long.join(weights_df, "stock")
    
    # Calculate weighted returns
    weighted_returns = weighted_returns.withColumn(
        "weighted_return", col("return") * col("weight")
    )
    
    # Aggregate to portfolio level by date
    portfolio_returns = weighted_returns.groupBy("date").agg(
        sum("weighted_return").alias("portfolio_return")
    )
    
    # Calculate VaR
    var_value = portfolio_returns.select(
        percentile_approx("portfolio_return", 1 - confidence_level, 10000).alias("VaR")
    ).collect()[0]["VaR"]
    
    # Return the absolute value as VaR is typically reported as a positive number
    return abs(var_value)
```

### Step 4: Implement Unit Tests

```python
def test_calculate_var():
    """Unit test for VaR calculation function"""
    # Create test data with known outcome
    test_schema = StructType([
        StructField("date", DateType(), False),
        StructField("Stock1", DoubleType(), True),
        StructField("Stock2", DoubleType(), True)
    ])
    
    test_data = [
        (dt.date(2023, 1, 1), -0.05, -0.03),
        (dt.date(2023, 1, 2), 0.02, 0.01),
        (dt.date(2023, 1, 3), 0.01, -0.01),
        (dt.date(2023, 1, 4), -0.02, 0.02),
        (dt.date(2023, 1, 5), 0.03, 0.02)
    ]
    
    test_df = spark.createDataFrame(test_data, test_schema)
    test_weights = {"Stock1": 0.6, "Stock2": 0.4}
    
    # With these values, the portfolio returns are:
    # [-0.042, 0.016, 0.002, -0.004, 0.026]
    # The 5% VaR should be 0.042
    
    var_result = calculate_var(test_df, test_weights, 0.95)
    
    # Assert with some tolerance for floating point
    assert abs(var_result - 0.042) < 0.001, f"Expected VaR around 0.042, got {var_result}"
    print("Unit test passed!")

# Run the unit test
test_calculate_var()
```

### Step 5: End-to-End Test

```python
def end_to_end_test():
    """End-to-end test for the VaR calculation pipeline"""
    # Calculate VaR with our sample data
    var_result = calculate_var(returns_df, weights, 0.95)
    
    print(f"95% VaR for the portfolio: {var_result:.4f} (or {var_result*100:.2f}%)")
    
    # Additional validation checks
    # 1. Check that VaR is positive
    assert var_result > 0, "VaR should be positive"
    
    # 2. Check that VaR is reasonable (typically between 0.5% and 10% for daily VaR)
    assert 0.005 <= var_result <= 0.10, f"VaR value {var_result} outside reasonable range"
    
    # 3. Verify with different confidence levels
    var_99 = calculate_var(returns_df, weights, 0.99)
    assert var_99 > var_result, "99% VaR should be higher than 95% VaR"
    
    print("End-to-end test passed!")

# Run the end-to-end test
end_to_end_test()
```

## Technical Differences: Excel vs. PySpark

## Business Value Differences

### Excel Limitations in Risk Management

1. **Limited Historical Data**: Excel's row limitations restrict the amount of historical data for VaR calculations
2. **Calculation Speed**: Slow processing for large portfolios or frequent recalculations
3. **Error Prone**: Manual formula adjustments can introduce errors
4. **Limited Scenario Analysis**: Difficult to run thousands of Monte Carlo simulations
5. **Collaboration Challenges**: Version control issues when multiple risk analysts work together

### PySpark Advantages for Financial Risk Management

1. **Comprehensive Risk Assessment**: Analyze entire trading history across all instruments 
2. **Real-time Risk Monitoring**: Process streaming market data for near-real-time VaR updates 
3. **Stress Testing at Scale**: Run thousands of scenarios simultaneously to identify vulnerabilities
4. **Multi-factor Risk Models**: Incorporate more risk factors than possible in Excel
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet stringent regulatory requirements with comprehensive data analysis
6. **Alternative Data Integration**: Incorporate non-traditional data sources for more robust risk assessment 

## Practical Applications in Finance Risk Management

With the PySpark implementation, financial institutions can:

1. **Intraday Risk Monitoring**: Calculate VaR multiple times per day across the entire portfolio
2. **Cross-Asset Risk Analysis**: Analyze correlations between different asset classes at scale
3. **Tail Risk Assessment**: Supplement VaR with additional metrics like Expected Shortfall
4. **Scenario Analysis**: Test portfolio performance under various market conditions
5. **Regulatory Reporting**: Generate comprehensive risk reports for Basel regulations
6. **Portfolio Optimization**: Use risk metrics to optimize portfolio allocation

## Conclusion

Migrating VaR calculations from Excel to PySpark represents a significant advancement in financial risk management capabilities. While Excel provides a familiar starting point for developing risk models, PySpark offers the scalability, reproducibility, and computational power needed for enterprise-level risk management in modern financial institutions.

The addition of proper testing frameworks ensures the reliability of these critical calculations, providing confidence in risk assessments that drive important business decisions.

Show some example code and example outcomes and explain the benefits and common pitfalls for that specific application.

# Practical Applications of PySpark in Finance Risk Management

Let's explore key PySpark applications in financial risk management, examining how each solves specific problems with example code, outcomes, benefits, and pitfalls.

## 1. Intraday Risk Monitoring

### Problem
Financial institutions need to continuously monitor portfolio risk throughout trading hours as market conditions change rapidly.

### Solution
PySpark enables near real-time VaR calculations by processing streaming market data and portfolio positions.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import window, col, sum, expr, percentile_approx
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, DoubleType, TimestampType

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Intraday Risk Monitoring") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Define schema for streaming market data
schema = StructType([
    StructField("timestamp", TimestampType(), False),
    StructField("instrument_id", StringType(), False),
    StructField("price", DoubleType(), False),
    StructField("volume", DoubleType(), True)
])

# Read streaming market data
market_data_stream = spark.readStream \
    .format("kafka") \
    .option("kafka.bootstrap.servers", "broker:9092") \
    .option("subscribe", "market_data") \
    .load() \
    .select(from_json(col("value").cast("string"), schema).alias("data")) \
    .select("data.*")

# Load portfolio positions (static for this example)
positions = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("AAPL", 1000),
    ("MSFT", 1500),
    ("AMZN", 200)
], ["instrument_id", "quantity"])

# Join streaming data with positions
position_values = market_data_stream \
    .join(positions, "instrument_id") \
    .withColumn("position_value", col("price") * col("quantity"))

# Calculate portfolio value in 5-minute windows
portfolio_values = position_values \
    .groupBy(window(col("timestamp"), "5 minutes")) \
    .agg(sum("position_value").alias("portfolio_value"))

# Calculate rolling VaR (simplified)
def calculate_var(df, window_size="30 minutes"):
    return df \
        .withWatermark("window", window_size) \
        .groupBy() \
        .agg(percentile_approx("portfolio_value", 0.05, 10000).alias("VaR_95"))

# Output results to dashboard
query = calculate_var(portfolio_values) \
    .writeStream \
    .outputMode("complete") \
    .format("console") \
    .start()

query.awaitTermination()
```

### Example Outcome
```
+-------------------+
|            VaR_95 |
+-------------------+
|          2450000  |
+-------------------+
```

### Benefits
- Enables timely risk-based decisions during market volatility
- Allows traders to adjust positions before end-of-day risk limits are breached
- Provides early warning signals for potential market stress

### Pitfalls
- Stream processing introduces complexity in error handling
- Requires careful handling of late-arriving data
- May generate false alarms during temporary market fluctuations

## 2. Credit Risk Analysis and Scoring

### Problem
Financial institutions need to assess borrower creditworthiness by analyzing large volumes of historical and alternative data.

### Solution
PySpark enables processing of diverse data sources to build and deploy credit risk models at scale.

## 3. Monte Carlo Simulations for Market Risk

### Problem
Financial institutions need to understand potential portfolio outcomes under thousands of market scenarios.

### Solution
PySpark enables parallel execution of Monte Carlo simulations to estimate VaR and other risk metrics.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit, expr
from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, DoubleType
import numpy as np

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Monte Carlo Simulations") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load portfolio data
portfolio = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("Equity", "AAPL", 1000000, 0.08, 0.25),
    ("Equity", "MSFT", 1500000, 0.07, 0.22),
    ("Bond", "US10Y", 2000000, 0.03, 0.05),
    ("FX", "EUR/USD", 800000, 0.01, 0.12)
], ["asset_class", "instrument", "position", "expected_return", "volatility"])

# Define simulation parameters
num_simulations = 10000
time_horizon = 10  # days
confidence_level = 0.99

# Define Monte Carlo simulation function
@udf(returnType=ArrayType(DoubleType()))
def simulate_returns(expected_return, volatility, position):
    daily_return = expected_return / 252
    daily_volatility = volatility / np.sqrt(252)
    
    # Generate random returns using geometric Brownian motion
    random_returns = np.random.normal(
        daily_return - 0.5 * daily_volatility**2, 
        daily_volatility, 
        (num_simulations, time_horizon)
    )
    
    # Calculate cumulative returns
    cumulative_returns = np.cumprod(np.exp(random_returns), axis=1)
    
    # Calculate final portfolio values
    final_values = position * cumulative_returns[:, -1]
    
    return final_values.tolist()

# Run simulations
simulated_portfolio = portfolio.withColumn(
    "simulated_values", 
    simulate_returns(col("expected_return"), col("volatility"), col("position"))
)

# Create a DataFrame with one row per simulation
simulation_results = simulated_portfolio.select(
    "asset_class", "instrument", "position", "simulated_values"
).selectExpr(
    "asset_class", "instrument", "position", "explode(simulated_values) as simulated_value"
)

# Aggregate results by simulation ID
portfolio_simulations = simulation_results.groupBy().pivot("instrument").sum("simulated_value")

# Calculate portfolio-level statistics
portfolio_stats = portfolio_simulations.select(
    expr("percentile_approx(AAPL + MSFT + US10Y + `EUR/USD`, 1-0.99, 10000)").alias("VaR_99"),
    expr("percentile_approx(AAPL + MSFT + US10Y + `EUR/USD`, 1-0.95, 10000)").alias("VaR_95"),
    expr("avg(AAPL + MSFT + US10Y + `EUR/USD`)").alias("Expected_Value")
)

portfolio_stats.show()
```

### Example Outcome
```
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+
|           VaR_99|           VaR_95|    Expected_Value|
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+
|         -452,367|         -298,124|        5,512,846 |
+-----------------+-----------------+------------------+
```

### Benefits
- Captures complex market dynamics and correlations
- Provides distribution of potential outcomes beyond point estimates
- Enables stress testing under extreme scenarios

### Pitfalls
- Results highly sensitive to model assumptions
- Computational intensity requires careful resource management
- Correlation assumptions may break down during market stress

## 4. Regulatory Reporting and Compliance

### Problem
Financial institutions must generate comprehensive risk reports for regulatory compliance (Basel III, FRTB, etc.).

### Solution
PySpark enables processing of enterprise-wide data to generate regulatory risk metrics and reports.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, sum, when, lit, expr
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Regulatory Risk Reporting") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load trading book data
trading_book = spark.read.parquet("s3://finance-data/trading_positions.parquet")

# Load market data
market_data = spark.read.parquet("s3://finance-data/market_data.parquet")

# Load risk factor sensitivities
risk_sensitivities = spark.read.parquet("s3://finance-data/risk_sensitivities.parquet")

# Join datasets
position_risk = trading_book \
    .join(market_data, "instrument_id") \
    .join(risk_sensitivities, "instrument_id")

# Calculate market value
position_risk = position_risk \
    .withColumn("market_value", col("quantity") * col("price"))

# Calculate risk-weighted assets (RWA) for credit risk
credit_rwa = position_risk \
    .withColumn("credit_rwa", 
                when(col("counterparty_rating") == "AAA", col("market_value") * 0.2)
                .when(col("counterparty_rating") == "AA", col("market_value") * 0.5)
                .when(col("counterparty_rating") == "A", col("market_value") * 0.7)
                .when(col("counterparty_rating") == "BBB", col("market_value") * 1.0)
                .when(col("counterparty_rating") == "BB", col("market_value") * 1.5)
                .when(col("counterparty_rating") == "B", col("market_value") * 2.5)
                .otherwise(col("market_value") * 4.0))

# Calculate market risk capital (simplified FRTB approach)
market_risk = position_risk \
    .withColumn("delta_risk", col("delta") * col("market_value") * col("risk_weight")) \
    .withColumn("vega_risk", col("vega") * col("market_value") * col("risk_weight") * 0.5) \
    .withColumn("curvature_risk", col("gamma") * col("market_value") * col("risk_weight") * 0.25)

# Aggregate by risk class
risk_by_class = market_risk \
    .groupBy("risk_class") \
    .agg(
        sum("delta_risk").alias("total_delta_risk"),
        sum("vega_risk").alias("total_vega_risk"),
        sum("curvature_risk").alias("total_curvature_risk")
    ) \
    .withColumn("total_market_risk", 
                col("total_delta_risk") + col("total_vega_risk") + col("total_curvature_risk"))

# Calculate liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)
liquidity_metrics = position_risk \
    .withColumn("hqla", 
                when(col("asset_class") == "Sovereign", col("market_value"))
                .when(col("asset_class") == "Cash", col("market_value"))
                .otherwise(0)) \
    .withColumn("outflow", 
                when(col("maturity") < 30, col("market_value"))
                .otherwise(0)) \
    .agg(
        sum("hqla").alias("total_hqla"),
        sum("outflow").alias("total_outflow")
    ) \
    .withColumn("lcr", col("total_hqla") / col("total_outflow"))

# Generate final regulatory report
regulatory_report = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("Credit RWA", credit_rwa.agg(sum("credit_rwa")).collect()[0][0]),
    ("Market Risk Capital", risk_by_class.agg(sum("total_market_risk")).collect()[0][0]),
    ("Liquidity Coverage Ratio", liquidity_metrics.select("lcr").collect()[0][0])
], ["metric", "value"])

regulatory_report.show()
```

### Example Outcome
```
+------------------------+---------------+
|                  metric|          value|
+------------------------+---------------+
|              Credit RWA|     325450000 |
|      Market Risk Capital|      42750000 |
|Liquidity Coverage Ratio|           1.24|
+------------------------+---------------+
```

### Benefits
- Consolidates data from multiple systems for consistent reporting
- Enables drill-down capabilities for regulatory inquiries
- Automates complex regulatory calculations

### Pitfalls
- Regulatory interpretations may vary across jurisdictions

## 5. Fraud Detection and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

### Problem
Financial institutions must identify suspicious transactions among billions of legitimate ones.

### Solution
PySpark enables real-time and batch processing of transaction data to detect potential fraud and money laundering.

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, window, avg, stddev, count, sum, when, expr
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Fraud Detection") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load transaction data
transactions = spark.read.parquet("s3://finance-data/transactions.parquet")

# Feature engineering for fraud detection
customer_profiles = transactions \
    .groupBy("customer_id") \
    .agg(
        avg("amount").alias("avg_amount"),
        stddev("amount").alias("stddev_amount"),
        count("transaction_id").alias("transaction_count"),
        avg(when(col("transaction_type") == "online", col("amount")).otherwise(0)).alias("avg_online_amount"),
        count(when(col("transaction_type") == "online", 1).otherwise(None)).alias("online_count"),
        avg(when(col("country") != "home_country", col("amount")).otherwise(0)).alias("avg_foreign_amount"),
        count(when(col("country") != "home_country", 1).otherwise(None)).alias("foreign_count")
    )

# Calculate transaction velocity
transaction_velocity = transactions \
    .groupBy("customer_id", window("timestamp", "1 hour")) \
    .count() \
    .groupBy("customer_id") \
    .agg(avg("count").alias("avg_hourly_transactions"), 
         stddev("count").alias("stddev_hourly_transactions"),
         max("count").alias("max_hourly_transactions"))

# Join features
fraud_features = customer_profiles.join(transaction_velocity, "customer_id")

# Prepare for anomaly detection
assembler = VectorAssembler(
    inputCols=["avg_amount", "stddev_amount", "transaction_count", 
               "avg_online_amount", "online_count", "avg_foreign_amount", 
               "foreign_count", "avg_hourly_transactions", 
               "max_hourly_transactions"],
    outputCol="features"
)

fraud_vectors = assembler.transform(fraud_features)

# Apply K-means clustering for anomaly detection
kmeans = KMeans(k=5, seed=42)
model = kmeans.fit(fraud_vectors.select("features"))
clustered = model.transform(fraud_vectors)

# Identify anomalous clusters
cluster_sizes = clustered.groupBy("prediction").count().collect()
smallest_clusters = sorted([(row["prediction"], row["count"]) for row in cluster_sizes], 
                          key=lambda x: x[1])[:2]
anomalous_clusters = [cluster[0] for cluster in smallest_clusters]

# Flag suspicious customers
suspicious_customers = clustered \
    .withColumn("suspicious", 
                when(col("prediction").isin(anomalous_clusters), 1).otherwise(0)) \
    .filter(col("suspicious") == 1)

# Generate alerts for recent transactions
alerts = transactions \
    .join(suspicious_customers.select("customer_id", "suspicious"), "customer_id") \
    .filter(col("timestamp") > expr("current_timestamp() - interval 1 day")) \
    .select("transaction_id", "customer_id", "timestamp", "amount", 
            "transaction_type", "country")

alerts.show()
```

### Example Outcome
```
+---------------+------------+-------------------+--------+----------------+---------+
|  transaction_id| customer_id|          timestamp|  amount|transaction_type|  country|
+---------------+------------+-------------------+--------+----------------+---------+
|      T98765432|     C123456|2025-03-01 09:45:22| 5000.00|          online|  Nigeria|
|      T98765433|     C123456|2025-03-01 09:47:15| 4500.00|          online|  Nigeria|
|      T98765450|     C789012|2025-03-01 12:32:08|12500.00|            atm|   Russia|
+---------------+------------+-------------------+--------+----------------+---------+
```

### Benefits
- Identifies complex fraud patterns across multiple transactions
- Reduces false positives compared to rule-based systems
- Adapts to evolving fraud techniques

### Pitfalls
- Imbalanced datasets make model training challenging
- Legitimate unusual transactions may trigger false alerts
- Requires careful handling of privacy concerns
